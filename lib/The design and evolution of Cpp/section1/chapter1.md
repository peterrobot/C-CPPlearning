# History

## Chapter 1 Ages before C++

### Simula and distributed system

> Simula: First released on 1967.5.20 by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard. It is considered to be the first object-oriented programming language.

Three feature in simula impress author a lot: **object oriented**, **co-routine**, **type system**. However the instance of simula is a catastrophe.

The criteria of an *appropriate tool*:

1. Good arrange of programme structure: **class** layer structure, **co-routine** support, class based strong **type check**.
2. Run **fast** and easy to **collaberate** with binary produce by other language.
3. Highly portable

## Chapter 2 C with Class

### Birth of C with Class

The very first version of C with Class is a pre-processing programme called Cpre in 10.1979. This programme add Simula-like Class feature but that is not evolutionary enough for a new language. The main focuses of this advanced C were as following:

1. Universal programming language
2. High performance
3. Capability with C

### Main feature

1. Class
2. Derived Class
3. `public`/`private` based access control
4. Constructor & destructor
5. Caller & return function (deleted later)
6. `friend` class
7. Function type check and conversion
8. `inline` function
9. Default argument
10. Operator override

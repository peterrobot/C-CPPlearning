# The designed and evolution of C++

Bjarne Stroustrup

## Introduction

The whole book is divided into two parts. The first part consists of eight chapters in which the author inspect the design, development, use and the procedure of standardization. The second part mainly focus on the future(after Release 1.0) development of C++ and each chapter in this part is weakly corresponded(or even no relevant at all).
As far as the author concerned, the comparison between C++ and other programming language is meaningless in most circumstances. This leads out author's main argument, that programming language is no longer purely a servant for abstract subject instead a general language should be an open stage for solving problems. Thus the design of a successful programming language should be open and interactive(with users/requirement).
